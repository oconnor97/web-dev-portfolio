## Description

This is an updated poersonal portfolio page designed to show employers applications that I have created. By using HTML and CSS I was able to make the site responsive and presentable across multiple devices.  It was exciting to get the chance to display my own personal style and be able to communicate my abilites through an active webpage.  Here you are able to view a few of my completed works!

Hopefully when presented with this page, people will get a look into who I am as a person and emplyoee!
